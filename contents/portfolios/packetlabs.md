My first project working overseas involved renewal the PacketLabs website.

When I was in Japan, a client handled the content aspect of the project, while other parts, like headlines and background images, which were updated infrequently, were hard-coded.

Nonetheless, the project needed most of the content displayed on the webpage to be updated without modifying the code. I developed various custom hooks to meet this requirement.

#### - RESULT

I enhanced the website's performance by about **20** points in the Lighthouse score compared to before the renewal.
