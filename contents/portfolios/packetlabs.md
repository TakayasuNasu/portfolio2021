My first project working abroad was the renewal of the PacketLabs website.

When I was in Japan, the client managed the content part of the project themselves, while other parts that were updated only a few times, such as headlines and background images, were hard-coded.

However, the project required that most of the content displayed on the page be updated without any code changes.
I created several custom hooks to put up that requirement.

#### - RESULT

I improved the performance of that site by around **20** points in the Lighthouse score compared to before the renewal.
