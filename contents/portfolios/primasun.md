#### The client's request was the following.

- Update their brand image as their business grows
- Enrich content and simplify management
- Performance Improvement
- Mobile Optimization


#### What did I do?

I improved the structure of the website by dividing it into modules, making it easier to manage and update.

This design also made it easier to add new pages. I also created multiple module types and developed corresponding components.
By using Grapheql to get the data needed to create pages and using switch to set up the modules needed for each page, the user can now display the modules they want in any order they want.

Since React Suspense is not available in Gatsby, we were able to use the Loadable Component instead to improve the site's performance. With these improvements, the website is now more usable and efficient.


#### - RESULT

The site was well received by the client. It led to a contract to support social media management.
