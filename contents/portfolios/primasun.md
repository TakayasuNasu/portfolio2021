While I was working for my previous company in Japan, our team faced a lot of tasks without enough members to handle them, despite the company's expanding business scale.
To improve our operational efficiency, we decided to develop a Single-Page-Application using Laravel, Vue.js, and Graphql, and established a deployment pipeline through Github and CirclCI.

#### - RESULT

Our goal was to share work knowledge using this web application and make it easier for users to find information quickly. As a result, the SPA we created was highly acclaimed and widely used by almost all of our employees on a daily basis.

#### - TECH STACK

> [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is an open-source PHP framework, which is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern. Laravel reuses the existing components of different frameworks which helps in creating a web application. The web application thus designed is more structured and pragmatic.

> [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.
