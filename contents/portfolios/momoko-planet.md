This project is the first big I have participated in. Until then, I worked on some small projects and fine-tuned codes and added small functions. I remember I was excited.  
Before join the project, I learned about Cakephp by myself. Because I didn't have knowledge of Cakephp. When it comes to web framework, I've had Struts and Zend framework of experience, but I've never used Cakephp.  
Thanks to that, I understood about site structure and how to develop.
This opportunity was very useful for me under my career. Because I acquired fundamental web technology such as HTTP, URI, and HTML.

#### - ABOUT CAKEPHP

> [CakePHP](https://book.cakephp.org/1.2/en/The-Manual/Beginning-With-CakePHP/What-is-CakePHP-Why-Use-it.html) is a free, open-source, rapid development framework for PHP. It’s a foundational structure for programmers to create web applications. Our primary goal is to enable you to work in a structured and rapid manner–without loss of flexibility.

When a web application is created, I think Cakephp supports development very well. The framework prepares some functions that when we create web applications in advance.

#### - IMPRESSIONS

Looking back, I think I was a junior developer. Because I wrote the code very fast, but I didn't know about design pattern and algorithms. That mean I knew only one way.
