Creation of portal sites for group companies and renewal of architect office sites.

I tried to keep all web application as simple as possible to make it easy to add and edit new features. 

I often went to our client's office to discus and to decide about business requirements and system requirements.

The company had only 3 developers, and less 10 employees in all.
