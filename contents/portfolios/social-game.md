This project was a mobile game development. The game is kind of social card game. About 5,000 to 10,000 active users played the game per day.

### - TEAM DEVELOPMENT

Our team did retrospective regularly and learned a lot of things from that.  
We discussed what we should keep from the previous iteration and what were the problems that happened in the previous iteration and how to solve those problems.

For example,
- I was able to spot small bugs and problems that I would not have noticed on my own.
- By sharing the team's mistakes, I was able to improve the quality of the code and services.
- Everyone's skills improved by sharing the team's knowledge.
