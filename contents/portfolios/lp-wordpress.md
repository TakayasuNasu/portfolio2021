During my time working for a previous company in Japan, I was responsible for developing 2-3 WordPress sites and creating 4-5 landing pages (LPs) each year.

One of the biggest challenges was accurately reproducing the UI designed by the team in code, with a focus on ensuring good SEO and site performance. Unfortunately, due to the heavy workload, I couldn't spend as much time on the creation process as I would have liked.

#### - IMPORTANCE

In addition to UI, it was also important to create engaging features like animations and micro-interactions that put the user experience first. And of course, all sites had to be designed to be responsive.

#### - RESULT

Despite the challenges, the knowledge and techniques I gained during this time have proven to be very valuable to me even today, as the importance of good UI/UX remains critical for creating successful websites.
