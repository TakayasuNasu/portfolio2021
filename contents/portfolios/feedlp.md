Our team was interested in creating a new revenue stream and thus began to consider leveraging data that another team had collected for Internet advertising. We focused on job sites and decided to build and market a job site that had an improved user interface and allowed for easy updates.

To ensure speed and performance, we developed the site's backend using Go and used React for the frontend. Additionally, we achieved auto-scaling through the use of AWS Fargate.

#### - RESULT

Since the site's launch, the improved UI has been well received and the number of users continues to increase gradually. This success has been a testament to our team's hard work and dedication to providing a high-quality job site that meets the needs of our users.
